### FlyTracker


#### System requirements:

* OSX 64-bit, Linux 64-bit, or Windows 64-bit
* Matlab R2013b or later (you can try your earlier version but functionality 
                          such as parallel processing may not work)


#### Quick start:

1. Add FlyTracker to your Matlab path by navigating to its directory and typing:
   ```
   modpath; savepath;
   ```

2. Collect all videos with identical filming- and experimental conditions into one folder.

3. Track all videos contained in a folder using the tracker interface:
   ```
   tracker
   ```
   Here you will calibrate your videos by pressing the [CALIBRATE] button.

4. View tracking results and annotate videos using the visualizer:
   ```
   visualizer
   ```
